# Introduction

**[Lit Protocol: Token Access](https://apps.shopify.com/lit-token-access)** is a Shopify app that allows merchants to
gate exclusive content and discounts, ensuring access to select parties only.

## Install

Although a public version is in the works, **Lit Protocol: Token Access** is currently a custom app and available by
request only.

## Uninstall

Go to the **Apps** section of your store's Shopify Admin and click the **Delete** button in the **Lit Protocol: Token
Access** app listing.

## Important

- **We highly recommend cloning a product template for use with products marked 'exclusive'.**  Directions can be found
  under the **[Creating a new product template](creating-a-new-product-template.md)** entry.
