# Updates

### Upcoming features.

There are in no particular order, but they are what is in active development.

- ability to offer a store wide discount
- allowing multiple products to be bundled together in the same offer
- letting merchants set a timeframe for the length of an offer
- allow merchants to limit the number of redemptions based on NFT ID

### Recent Additions

2022-5-9

- <strong>Limit on number of redemptions per wallet</strong>: in
  the <strong>Create Token Access</strong>
  modal there is now an additional input that lets you dictate
  how many times a wallet can redeem a given offer. It is wallet
  based right now, so there is still the issue of someone taking
  an NFT, moving it to another wallet and checking out again. We
  will be adding a redemption limiter based on NFT ID in the
  future, but it's not quite ready yet.
- Redo styling for verification and redemption flow to fix the mobile view.
