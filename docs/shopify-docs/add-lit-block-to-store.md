# Add Lit App Block to store

The Lit App Block is an theme-app-extension used to show customers which products have been gated.

On products with an associated **discount**, the block will render in addition to the **Buy** and **Add to cart** buttons.

On products with an associated **exclusive**, the block will remove the **Buy** and **Add to cart** buttons, but this could possibly be circumvented.
**We highly recommend creating a new product template for 'exclusives' with the Shopify purchase options removed.** Instructions to do so can be found in the **[Creating a new product template](creating-a-new-product-template.md)** section.

1. Go to the nav in Shopify Admin and go to the **Online Store**.

5. Select the **Lit App Block** to add it.  It can be placed anywhere, but we recommend having it next to the **Buy buttons**.

8. Optional -  The colors and text of the block can now be customized to match your store's theme.
